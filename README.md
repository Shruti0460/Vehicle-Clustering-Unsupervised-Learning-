# Vehicle-Clustering-Unsupervised-Learning-
You are working for an automotive company, and your task is to cluster vehicles into groups based on their features such as weight, engine size, and horsepower.     


In this exercise, you used KMeans clustering to group vehicles based on their features like weight, engine size, and horsepower.

## Expected Results
-  Cluster Visualization - The scatter plot will visually depict how vehicles are grouped based on weight and horsepower. Each cluster will be represented by a different color. With synthetic data, the distinctness of clusters may vary, but students should be able to see groupings based on the chosen features.
-  Interpreting Clusters - There are no 'correct' labels in unsupervised learning, but students should observe how vehicles are grouped based on similarities in their features. They might see, for example, that heavier vehicles with higher horsepower are grouped together.

  
  In both tasks, the exact numerical results can vary based on the randomness in the synthetic data generation and the inherent variability in machine learning models. The key learning outcome is understanding the process of applying machine learning techniques and interpreting the results, rather than achieving specific numerical accuracy or clustering results.
